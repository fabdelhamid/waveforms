Flexible Audio Description Interpreter

About
	FADI is a C-like waveform description language. It can:

		- Construct vectored waveforms (e.g. [LINK]a sinusoidal wave) from an easy-to-understand description.

		- Process waveform transitions (e.g. [LINK]10-degree incremental phase-shift of a waveform or [LINK]morphing a square wave to a sawtooth over 5 		  	  seconds) both statically or as a real-time synthesizer


	FADI code can also be compiled to bytecode, and run on a [LINK]dedicated real-time board. This offers improved performance with
	real-time projects that are computationally intensive .
